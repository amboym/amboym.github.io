### Analysis of DJ Sets 
__Python__

Exploring DJ sets, using seaborn and matplotlib in Python. In this project I sought out to see how my setlist compares to my favourite DJ's
- This project aims to leverage the Spotify Web API to extract track information from selected DJ playlists. By utilizing the Spotify API, the project retrieves track URIs from playlists belonging to various DJs, facilitating the analysis of audio features across different sets and comparison of my own set to theirs. github: [here](https://github.com/amboym/DJset)

### Portfolio Management 
__Python__

Analysis and breakdown of stock portfolio and application of Harry Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory, in Python.

-Utilizing Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory through Python, I employed the yfinance API to extract historical stock data for the assets within my portfolio. Subsequently, I generated random weights to construct a set of n = 1000000 feasible portfolios and identified an optimal stock allocation based on the Max Sharpe Ratio.
- Following this, adjustments were made to certain stocks in the portfolio to enhance diversification. A comparative analysis was then conducted between the original and modified portfolios, yielding valuable observations on their respective characteristics and performance. github:[here](https://github.com/amboym/StockPortfolioAnalysis/blob/main/README.md)
